Right-click or use the document menu → select **Translate Whole Script**.\n2. Configure your options in the modal:\n   - **Target Language:** Choose from 18 supported languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic (RTL), Russian, Turkish, and Thai.\n   - **Elements & Tone:** Choose which screenplay elements to translate (Dialogue, Action, Scene Headings, Parentheticals, Transitions) and pick custom phrasing tones (Natural/Conversational, Literal, or Casual).\n   - **Custom Instructions:** Provide optional per-document translation guidance (e.g., dialect registers, character idioms, cultural context).\n   - **Character Names:** Option to keep character names unchanged to prevent proper noun mistranslation.\n   - **AI Model:** Select your preferred local (Ollama) or remote API model.\n3. ActOne duplicates your document into a target script (e.g., `MyScript-Tamil`) and runs a pre-flight connection check before starting.\n4. **Scene-by-Scene Engine:** ActOne translates scene by scene with complete narrative context rather than isolated line batches. Long scenes are adaptively partitioned at character boundaries to maintain context window stability.\n5. The progress window displays the active scene heading, part count for long scenes, real-time status (including provider rate-limit wait countdowns), percentage bar, time remaining estimates, and a live streaming preview.\n6. Click **\"Run in Background\"** to dismiss the progress window anytime and keep writing in other scripts.\n7. If any scenes fail after automatic retries, the completion screen gives you a **\"Retry Failed Scenes\"** button to re-run them with one click.\n8. Once complete, click **\"Open Translated Script\"** to view your translated screenplay."
