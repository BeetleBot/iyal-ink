Click the X to remove from the list. Stored in localStorage (up to 10 entries).\n\n**Footer actions:**\n- **Help** — Opens the Help Wiki window with searchable documentation.\n- **Discord** — Opens the ActOne Discord invite in your default browser.\n- **Quick Settings** (gear icon) — Open the settings sidebar to switch themes, adjust scale, and more.\n- **App version** — Build number, useful when reporting bugs.\n\nThe Welcome screen also shows a rotating random writing quote from famous screenwriters. The top bar is draggable (window drag) and hosts a subtle Update pill when an update is available."

Each family (Classic, Catppuccin, Pitch) has its own adaptive option. The transition happens instantly — no refresh needed.\n\nQuick-switch between any theme from the **Quick Settings** menu (gear icon in the Activity Bar) — a theme grid with 2×2 color cubes organized by section.

Custom themes appear under a \"CUSTOM\" section in the Theme Manager.\n\n---\n\n### Design System: Warm Craft Aesthetic\n\nActOne uses the **Arc / Craft** design system — a warm, tactile, literary workshop aesthetic defined in `DESIGN.md`:\n\n- **Rounded Capsules & Cards**: All surfaces use a harmonious radius scale — `4px` (chips/mini badges), `6px` (buttons/inputs/menu items), `8px` (tab pills/cards), `12px` (floating panels/modals), `16px` (welcome canvas), `9999px` (pill search bars/status capsules). No sharp `0px` corners appear in user-facing UI except the simulated manuscript page edges.\n- **Dual-Layer Ambient Shadows**: Soft diffused shadows (`--shadow-xs/sm/md/lg/floating`) create layered paper depth — active tab pills, scene cards, and dialogs float with subtle ambient diffusion rather than harsh black drops.\n- **Floating Pill Tabs & Controls**: Header tabs are pill capsules (`20px` radius) with primary-dot active indicators and amber dirty dots; window controls are `28px` rounded squares with soft hover glows.\n- **Pill Search & Toggles**: All filter/search inputs are pill-shaped (`9999px` radius); toggle groups (e.g. Settings tabs) are pill segmented controls with soft paper shadows on the active segment.\n- **Minimal Pill Scrollbars**: Thin `6px` capsule scroll thumbs with ambient hover, not blocky 10px bars.\n- **Premium Buttons**: Primary actions use pill (`20px`) contained buttons; secondary actions use outlined pills — both with tactile hover lifts and spring press feedback."

OpenAI-compatible API** — Use any compatible chat-completion endpoint.\n  - **Provider**: Select \"OpenAI API\".\n  - **Active Model**: Choose from your configured API entries in the Muse panel or Settings.\n  - **Configure Providers**: Click \"Configure Providers\" to manage multiple API connections.\n    - Click **\"Add API\"** to create a new entry.\n    - Fill in: **Name**, **Endpoint URL**, **API Key**, and **Model**.\n    - Click an entry card to select it as active.\n    - Use the pencil icon to edit, trash icon to delete.\n    - The endpoint URL is used as-is — no `/chat/completions` is appended automatically.\n\n**2. Ollama (Local)** — Run models locally on your machine.\n  - **Provider dropdown**: Select \"Ollama (Local)\".\n  - **Ollama URL**: Defaults to `http://localhost:11434`.\n  - **Model**: Select from the dropdown of models available on your Ollama server.\n\n**System Prompt:**\n- The default system prompt defines Muse's personality: kind, intelligent, concise, and screenwriting-focused.\n- You can customize the system prompt via **Settings → Muse → System Prompt**.\n**Temperature:**\n- Controls randomness (0.0 = more precise, 1.0 = more creative).\n- Chat default: 0.7. Rephrase default: 0.1. Translation default: 0.1.\n\n**Provider data:** When OpenAI-compatible is selected, prompts and screenplay context are sent to the configured endpoint. When Ollama is selected, they are sent to the configured Ollama server. API keys are currently stored in localStorage."

      "content": "Muse can use structured tools when a request requires screenplay information or an ActOne action. You do not need to type a special command. Ask in normal language, for example:\n\n- \"Read scene 3 and summarize the conflict.\"\n- \"Find every scene where MAYA appears.\"\n- \"Search for references to the red suitcase.\"\n- \"Draft a replacement for the current scene in Fountain.\"\n- \"Add a purple tag to scene 5.\"\n- \"Create a profile for the protagonist and show it in X-Ray.\"\n\n**Read and analysis tools include:**\n\n- Read a scene by its scene index.\n- Search screenplay lines.\n- Find a character's scenes and co-stars.\n- Find scenes by location.\n- Calculate screenplay statistics.\n- Search a character's dialogue.\n- Read the lines around the active cursor.\n- Read title-page metadata.\n- Read saved todos, parking notes, and character profiles.\n\n**Action tools include:**\n\n- Draft a scene replacement for review.\n- Add a project todo.\n- Add a parking note.\n- Add a color or storyline tag to a scene heading.\n- Create or update an X-Ray character profile.\n- Open the X-Ray window.\n\n**Review behavior:**\n\n- Scene replacement is shown as a pending Fountain draft. Review it before applying it to the editor.\n- Other current settings and editor actions may be applied immediately when Muse calls them. Check the affected file and save a snapshot before large operations.\n- Scene references currently use the screenplay's ordinal scene index. If the screenplay uses printed Fountain scene numbers such as `#42#`, state the heading as well to avoid ambiguity.\n\n**Important limitations:**\n\n- Muse's current tool protocol is model-generated JSON/text, so tool calls may fail with smaller models.\n- The current implementation does not provide a universal approval dialog for every mutation.\n- Todos, parking notes, and character profiles are ActOne metadata. Save the screenplay as an ActOne Bundle (`.actone`) when you need those settings to persist with the project.\n- Treat generated facts and profile details as suggestions. Verify them against the screenplay before relying on them."
